Hello friends, Iâ€™m @jsmorgan9573
I have been making short stop frame animation clips and skits with friends and family since the 60s (it was 8mm film back then)
These days I use iClone to create avatars of my grandkids and have produced some pretty fun MP4 videos.
I've been playing with ComfyUI for a few weeks and it's absolutely amazing. I love it, but I have a big problem.
I'm 70 this year, I was a process controls engineer for more than 40 years until I contracted Cancer in 2009. I had the surgery, 8 months of chemotherapy and came through just fine. 
In 2019 the cancer returned and it was a little more of a struggle than the previous ordeal in that the chemo took more of a toll on my cognative skills and short term memory (they call it chemo brain)
The reason I'm revealing all this is to illustrate the reasons I'm having so much trouble learning how to code a workflow of what I'm trying to do.
I'm reaching out to all the brilliant coders here hoping someone could help me out. I've managed to get a few workflows to function after hours of hunting down the required models and nodes called for, but most of them fail 
either because I can't find the required modules or when I do find them I don't know which comfyui folder to put them in. It's becomming very frustrating.
My goal is to create a video to video workflow that will take my iClone productions (mp4's) and process them through a styler and upscaler to make them appear less cartoonish and more like real world scenes.
I'm not even sure it's possible to do. I even rotoscoped an mp4 into hundreds of single frame images hoping to process each image separately and then stich them back into a video (without much luck)
I'm working with an Asustek ROG strix PC, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-14700F processor, 32GB ram, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060i with 8GB of vram.
I would truely appreciate any help or insight offered.

Thanks for listening,
